                Given a set of chessboard images, our objective is to determine
                the size of the chessboard present in each image accurately.
                This entails identifying the arrangement and count of the
                squares that compose the chessboard layout. We kindly ask you to
                define a comprehensive processing pipeline that can be applied
                uniformly to all images within the set. This pipeline should
                encompass all necessary steps, from initial image acquisition
                and preprocessing to the final determination of the chessboard
                size. Furthermore, it is essential that all images captured from
                the same scene are processed using consistent parameter values
                whenever applicable, to ensure reliable and comparable results
                across the dataset.

                <p class="part-content">
                  Upon observation, we notice sinusoidal noise in two of the
                  four images. To address this, we first transform the images
                  into the frequency domain using FFT and extract the magnitude
                  spectrum of all four images. <br />
                  The image with sinusoidal noise exhibits two bright points
                  along the x-axis in the frequency domain. These points are
                  carefully removed to eliminate the noise while preserving
                  critical details in the image.

                <p class="part-content">
                  After applying a threshold to the spectrum image, we observe
                  three bright points along the x-axis. The central point,
                  however, is crucial and must be preserved. To achieve this, we
                  create a mask to protect the central point, leaving only the
                  two noise points. Using the original image, we subtract these
                  two points to remove the sinusoidal noise.

                <p class="part-part-title">Step 3: Mean Filtering</p>
                <p class="part-content">
                  Mean filtering is a simple and effective image smoothing
                  technique that helps reduce noise in an image. It works by
                  replacing each pixel's value with the average value of its
                  neighboring pixels within a specified kernel size. This
                  operation effectively smoothens the image, making it easier to
                  analyze or process further.
                </p>
                <p class="part-content">
                  The mean filter is applied by sliding a square kernel, such as
                  3x3 or 5x5, across the image and calculating the average of
                  the pixel values within the kernel at each position. This new
                  averaged value replaces the central pixel of the kernel,
                  resulting in a smoother image with less high-frequency noise.
                </p>
                <p class="part-content">
                  While mean filtering is effective at noise reduction, it can
                  also blur edges and reduce image detail. As such, it is most
                  useful in applications where preserving edges is less critical
                  or in combination with other filtering techniques to achieve
                  the desired result.

                <p class="part-content">
                  In this step, we use the Canny edge detection algorithm to
                  identify the edges in the image. Canny is a popular method due
                  to its ability to detect edges with precision while minimizing
                  noise and false positives.
                </p>
                <p class="part-content">
                  The Canny algorithm works in several stages: it applies
                  Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise, computes gradients to
                  highlight regions with high intensity changes, and uses
                  non-maximum suppression to remove weak edges. Finally, double
                  thresholding and edge tracking are performed to connect edge
                  segments and retain only significant edges.

                  Morphological operations such as opening and closing are
                  applied in this step to refine the shapes of the detected
                  objects. These techniques help remove noise, fill small gaps
                  within objects, and connect fragmented edges into more unified
                  lines.

                <p class="part-content">
                  The opening operation, which involves erosion followed by
                  dilation, removes small noise points, while the closing
                  operation, a dilation followed by erosion, bridges small gaps
                  in the edges. Together, they enhance the clarity and
                  continuity of the lines in the image.

                  By carefully calibrating the size of the structuring element

                  In this step, the Hough Transform is used to detect straight
                  lines in the image. This method works by transforming points
                  in the image space into a parameter space defined by two
                  values: <em>rho</em>, the distance from the origin to the
                  line, and <em>theta</em>, the angle of the line. Each point in
                  the image votes for potential lines, and lines with enough
                  votes are identified as significant.

                  minimum number of votes required to confirm a line, is
                  crucial. Multiple tests may be necessary to find the best
                  combination that accurately captures the desired lines while

                  After detecting lines using the Hough Transform, redundant
                  lines are removed to improve clarity and reduce overlap. Lines

                The evaluation results show that each image is expected to have
                11 vertical lines and 7 horizontal lines. Adding 1 to these
                counts should give the chessboard dimensions as 12 and 8.
                However, the number of detected lines for each image is as
                follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image 1:</strong> Vertical lines (filtered): 13,
                  Horizontal lines (filtered): 7
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image 2:</strong> Vertical lines (filtered): 13,
                  Horizontal lines (filtered): 7
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image 3:</strong> Vertical lines (filtered): 14,
                  Horizontal lines (filtered): 7
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image 4:</strong> Vertical lines (filtered): 14,
                  Horizontal lines (filtered): 7
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="part-content">
                The horizontal lines are detected correctly in all cases.
                However, for the vertical lines, some issues are observed. The
                Hough Transform sometimes identifies two lines on either side of
                a main line, leading to extra detections. Additionally, some
                vertical lines are missed. As a result, the final counts for
                vertical lines are 13 or 14 instead of the expected 11.

                After experimenting with different parameter values, we obtained
                the following settings for the main steps below. While the
                results are acceptable, they are not yet perfect. In the future,
                we plan to explore further improvements to accurately determine
                the true size and structure of the chessboard.
